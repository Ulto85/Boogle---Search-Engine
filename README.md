# Boogle---Search-Engine

Have you ever wanted a search engine without all those annoying cookies? Well look no further. The Boogle Search Engine is the most "reliable". With just a few words Boogle will help trim down your search and help get an answer. Enjoy - Robowolf:)

## INSTRUCTIONS
+ When ever there is no option click ENTER
+ For the languages clicking ENTER will keep the language the same
+ Always type 'a' or '1' instead of 'a.' or '1.'
Also Wikipedia API doesn't support some page id's so even though your search shows up during the narrowing process it still might not work.
